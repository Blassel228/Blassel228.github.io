                        Beef bourguignon is a rich and complex stew originating from the region of Burgundy in France. The star of the dish is a robust red Burgundy wine, which is used to soften and tenderize tough cuts of Charolais beef, along with savory additions such as onions, garlic, thyme, carrots, potatoes, mushrooms, and sometimes a few strips of dried orange peel to make the flavors even richer.

                        This French classic is made by slow-roasting duck meat in its own fat. What was once used as a method of preserving meat in times before refrigeration is nowadays enjoyed as a rich and flavorful dish of its own. The meat is typically seasoned with salt, pepper, and fresh herbs and spices such as thyme, garlic, shallots, and bay leaves.

                        Entrecôte is a type of beef steak that's cut from between the ribs, but it's more commonly known as a thin and boneless rib-eye steak. The butchers cut bone-in rib-eyes with the bone on each side, but there are also six leftover boneless steaks from the meat between each bone-in rib-eye, and they're known as the entrecôtes.

                        This powerful red wine hails from the southern Rhône, and it is mostly based on Grenache with small proportions of Syrah and Mourvedre. Often compared to the more famous Châteauneuf-du-Pape, these robust wines are characterized by their deep ruby color and complex aromas of ripe red and black fruit that are complemented by spicy and earthy nuances of licorice, cocoa, or chocolate. Gigondas is a full-bodied wine with powerful tannins that tend to mellow with age, resulting in more refined expressions.
